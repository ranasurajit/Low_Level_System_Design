# üöï Ride Notification System ‚Äì SOLID Principle: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This project showcases the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** using a ride completion notification system in a cab service app.

---

## üìå What is DIP?

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**  
> **"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."**

---

## ‚ùå Original Problem (DIP Violation)

In the original version:
- `RideService` directly instantiated `EmailNotificationService` and `SMSNotificationService`.
- This tightly coupled the business logic to specific implementations.
- It violated DIP, making it difficult to extend or test.

## ‚úÖ Refactored Design (DIP Compliant)

### Key Components:

| Type                   | Name                        | Role                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Interface (Abstraction)| `INotificationService`      | Defines `sendNotification()`                  |
| Concrete Classes       | `EmailNotificationService`, `SMSNotificationService`, `WhatsAppNotificationService` | Implement the interface |
| Enum                  | `NotificationTypesEnum`     | Defines supported notification types           |
| Factory               | `NotificationFactory`       | Creates notification services                  |
| High-level Module     | `RideService`               | Depends only on the abstraction                |
| Composition Root      | `Main.java`                 | Assembles services and injects dependencies    |

---

## üß† Dependency Flow

```
Main.java

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ creates List<INotificationService> via NotificationFactory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RideService uses constructor injection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sendNotification() called on each implementation
```

- `RideService` does **not** know about email, SMS, or WhatsApp directly.
- You can now easily add `PushNotificationService` without touching `RideService`.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Summary

| Principle Criteria                                   | Status |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| High-level module depends on abstraction            | ‚úÖ     |
| Low-level modules implement abstraction             | ‚úÖ     |
| No direct dependency on concrete classes            | ‚úÖ     |
| Constructor-based dependency injection used         | ‚úÖ     |
| Factory pattern handles instantiation logic         | ‚úÖ     |
| Easily extensible and testable                      | ‚úÖ     |

## üèÅ Conclusion

The project now demonstrates a **textbook implementation of DIP** with clean separation between:
- What is done (notification)
- How it‚Äôs done (email, SMS, WhatsApp)

‚úÖ **DIP Evaluation: PASS**
