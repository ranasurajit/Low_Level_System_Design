💳 Payment Processing System – Strategy Design Pattern
======================================================

This project demonstrates how to apply the Strategy Design Pattern to support multiple payment methods in a clean, extensible way.

* * *

✅ Objective
-----------

Refactor a tightly-coupled `PaymentService` that originally used conditional logic (if-else) to select the payment method.

* * *

❌ Original Issues
-----------------

*   Payment methods were hardcoded inside the service class.
    
*   Any new payment method required modifying existing code.
    
*   Violated Open/Closed Principle (OCP).
    
*   Difficult to test and extend.
    

* * *

🧠 Strategy Pattern Solution
----------------------------

*   Created a `PaymentStrategy` interface defining a common payment method.
    
*   Developed concrete implementations like CreditCard, UPI, PayPal, and Cash.
    
*   `PaymentService` is decoupled and accepts any strategy via its constructor.
    
*   Behavior is interchangeable at runtime without modifying core logic.
    

* * *

🏆 Benefits Achieved
--------------------

*   Clean separation of concerns
    
*   Behavior is injected and interchangeable
    
*   Open for extension, closed for modification
    
*   Easily testable in isolation
    
*   Readable and maintainable client code
    

* * *

🎓 Conclusion
-------------

This exercise successfully applies the Strategy Pattern to solve real-world problems like payment processing.  
It enhances code flexibility, promotes SOLID principles, and prepares the system for future scaling with minimal changes.
