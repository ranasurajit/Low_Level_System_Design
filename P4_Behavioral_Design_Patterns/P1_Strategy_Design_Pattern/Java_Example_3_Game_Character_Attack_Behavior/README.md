# Strategy Design Pattern

## 🧠 Pattern Implemented: Strategy Pattern

### 👨‍💻 Author Assessment
You have successfully implemented the **Strategy Design Pattern** using a game character scenario. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

---

## ✅ What Was Done Well

### 1. Correct Application of the Pattern
- You defined a strategy interface `AttackStrategy` with a method `attack()`.
- You implemented multiple concrete strategies: `SwordAttackStrategy`, `BowAttackStrategy`, and `MagicAttackStrategy`.
- The `GameCharacter` class uses composition to hold a reference to the `AttackStrategy`, which is a key aspect of the Strategy Pattern.
- You invoked the `attack()` method via `performAction()` method in `GameCharacter`, demonstrating behavior delegation.

### 2. Clean Code & Naming
- Your class and method names are intuitive and descriptive.
- The structure is readable and logically organized.

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- The attack behavior is cleanly separated from the `GameCharacter` class.
- Adding a new attack type (e.g., `LaserAttackStrategy`) does not require changing existing code.

### 4. Flexible Design
- Follows the **Open/Closed Principle** (OCP) from SOLID principles.
- Supports different attack behaviors through composition.

## 🛠️ Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Support Runtime Strategy Switching (Optional)
To show deeper understanding during interviews, allow dynamic behavior changes:

```java
public void setAttackStrategy(AttackStrategy strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
}
```

Then use:

```java
knight.setAttackStrategy(new MagicAttackStrategy());
knight.performAction(); // Output: Casting a fireball!
```

This allows the strategy to change based on game level, environment, etc.

### 2. Defensive Programming
- Handle `null` strategy cases gracefully or use a `DefaultAttackStrategy` to prevent `NullPointerException`.
- Consider logging or `toString()` overrides for better runtime introspection.

## 📈 Verdict: Strong Pass ✅

Your implementation shows:

- ✅ Clear understanding of the Strategy Pattern.
- ✅ Proper use of composition and polymorphism.
- ✅ Readiness for low-level system design interviews.

---

## 🧭 What's Next?

Now that you've mastered Strategy Pattern, consider exploring:

- **Decorator Pattern** – to dynamically add responsibilities
- **Command Pattern** – to encapsulate actions as objects
- **Observer Pattern** – for publish-subscribe communication

Feel free to request a starter project for any of these patterns.

Keep up the great work! 🚀
